1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we need to collaborate.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we know, when to merge the two repository. Actually, it's a tricky question. I don't think, even I know when exactly to pull or push.
